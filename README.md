# 📅 Simple Python Calendar with Smart Suggestions

Hey there! 👋  
This is a mini Python project I built as part of my learning journey. It’s a calendar app that not only shows the calendar for any month and year — it also gives fun little AI-style suggestions to keep life on track ✨

---

## 🛠️ What It Does

- 📆 Shows a monthly calendar based on user input
- 💡 Gives random suggestions like “Plan a study schedule” or “Take a break” – feels a bit like your personal assistant 😄
- 🐍 Built using basic Python modules like calendar and random

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I’m currently learning Python and building simple apps to improve my skills. I wanted to go beyond just printing the calendar and make it feel helpful — so I added some smart suggestion logic too! This is just a small step, but every line of code gets me closer to my goals 💻🌍

## 🚀 How to Run It

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer  
2. Copy the code into a file like calendar_ai.py
3. Run it in the terminal:

#```bash
python calendar_ai.py


SAMPLE OUTPUT

Enter year (e.g., 2025): 2025
Enter month (1-12): 7

     July 2025
Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
